## What is ZapCli

**ZapCli** is an open-source algorithmic trading engine that simplifies the process of backtesting your trading strategies.

It provides essential data and core functions, enabling you to concentrate on developing reusable trading strategies, indicators, and analyzers, rather than spending time on building infrastructure.

**ZapCli** supports writing algorithms in:

* [**zplang**](https://zplang.com), an open-source programming language inspired by Clojure, designed for easy creation of trading automations
* **JavaScript**

**ZapCli** is the engine that drives the bots trading platform[ zapant.com](https://zapant.com)
